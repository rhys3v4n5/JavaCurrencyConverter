# Java Currency Converter
I started this project when I was originally learning Java. It's goal is to allow you to convert GBP into other currencies. I have used JavaFX to create visual elements, I plan to revisit this project
with my new knowledge of java and programming in-general to update the program.

Any commits made by rhysevs1912 - this is me, at the time of creating the repo for some reason my Windows PC was using a different GitHub account.
